# Healthcare Backend Implementation Summary

## Project Structure
- **Authentication App**: Handles user registration, login, and JWT token management
- **Patients App**: Manages patient records with CRUD operations
- **Doctors App**: Manages doctor records with CRUD operations
- **Mappings App**: Handles the relationship between patients and doctors

## Features Implemented
1. **User Authentication**
   - Registration with name, email, and password
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - User profile management

2. **Patient Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete patient records
   - Patient records are associated with the authenticated user
   - Secure access control (only the owner can modify their patients)

3. **Doctor Management**
   - Create, read, update, and delete doctor records
   - Doctor records are associated with the authenticated user
   - All authenticated users can view doctors

4. **Patient-Doctor Mapping**
   - Assign doctors to patients
   - View all doctors assigned to a specific patient
   - Remove doctor assignments from patients
   - Security checks to ensure only the patient's owner can manage mappings

5. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL integration
   - Django ORM for database modeling

6. **Security**
   - JWT authentication for API endpoints
   - Permission-based access control
   - Password validation

## API Endpoints
- **Authentication**
  - POST /api/auth/register/ - Register a new user
  - POST /api/auth/login/ - Log in and get JWT token
  - GET /api/auth/me/ - Get user profile

- **Patient Management**
  - POST /api/patients/ - Add a new patient
  - GET /api/patients/ - Get all patients for the authenticated user
  - GET /api/patients/<id>/ - Get patient details
  - PUT /api/patients/<id>/ - Update patient
  - DELETE /api/patients/<id>/ - Delete patient

- **Doctor Management**
  - POST /api/doctors/ - Add a new doctor
  - GET /api/doctors/ - Get all doctors
  - GET /api/doctors/<id>/ - Get doctor details
  - PUT /api/doctors/<id>/ - Update doctor
  - DELETE /api/doctors/<id>/ - Delete doctor

- **Patient-Doctor Mapping**
  - POST /api/mappings/ - Assign doctor to patient
  - GET /api/mappings/ - Get all mappings for the authenticated user's patients
  - GET /api/mappings/patient/<patient_id>/ - Get doctors for a specific patient
  - DELETE /api/mappings/<id>/ - Remove doctor from patient

## Testing
- Postman collection included for API testing
- Test data creation command for quick setup

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `healthcare_db`
2. Configure database settings in `.env` file
3. Run the application using the provided scripts:
   - Windows: `run.bat`
   - Linux/Mac: `run.sh`

## Next Steps
- Add more comprehensive input validation
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add unit and integration tests
- Implement API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Add more advanced search and filtering options
